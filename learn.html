<h1 style="font-size: 8vw;"> Children Labour</h1>
<p style="font-size:large;"> <b> Child labour is defined as the regular employment of boys and girls under the age of 15 or 16. 
  Attitudes toward child labour have altered dramatically since the late 18th century, when it was
   generally assumed that children should contribute to the family economy from about age seven.
   By the beginning of the 20th century most Canadian provinces had enacted labour legislation 
  to restrict the employment of children.

  <h1 style="font-size: 8vh;">What is child labour?
  </h1>
  <p><b>Child labour refers to work that children are too young to perform or that –
    by its nature or circumstances – can be hazardous. Unlike activities that help children develop
    (such as contributing to light housework or taking on a job during school holidays), 
    child labour causes harm to a child’s health, safety or moral development.
    
    In its most insidious forms, child labour can amount to slavery or practices similar to slavery, 
    including the sale and trafficking of children. In some places, children may be forcibly recruited
    into armed conflict, used in the production and trafficking of drugs, or offered into prostitution.

  <h3 id="dynamic-text">Global progress against child labour has recently stagnated:
The proportion of children in child labour remained roughly unchanged since data were collected in 2016.
Similarly, the percentage of children in hazardous work has also persisted.
But global estimates mask large variations across regions. 
In both Asia and the Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean, 
child labour has trended downward in percentage and absolute terms

<h1 style="font-size: 7vw;"> What are the greatest risks associated with child labour?
</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p> <mark>
  No matter where or how it occurs, child labour restricts children from their most fundamental rights. 
  Many children driven into labour are cut off from schooling and health care – often at the time they need it most.
  In mining, they may be forced to work in deep underground shafts, to haul heavy loads of rock and to use toxic 
  chemicals to separate minerals or precious metals from ore.
</mark></p></div>
<br>
<p> <h4>On the streets, traffic and exhaust fumes threaten children’s health and safety – as does, in extreme cases,
  the risk of being drawn into illicit activities.
  These are just a few of the dangers children driven into work may face. 
  What’s more, the isolated nature of some forms of child labour puts them at significant risk of abuse and trafficking.</h4></p>

    <h1 style="font-size: 7dhw;">  Why does child labour occur?</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
<p style="font-size: larger;"> <h4>  Children may be driven into work for various reasons.
  Most often, child labour occurs when families face financial challenges or uncertainty 
  – whether due to poverty, sudden illness of a caregiver, or job loss of a primary wage earner. </h4>
</p>
  <p> <h4> 
  Migrant and refugee children – many of whom have been uprooted by conflict, disaster or poverty –

    <p>
      There is no universally accepted definition of child labour. Varying definitions of the term are
       used by international organisations, non-governmental organisations, trade unions and other interest 
       groups. There are also varying opinions about who exactly counts as a child. While international conventions
        define children as people aged 18 and under, individual governments — and indeed, different cultures — 
        may define “children” according to different ages or other criteria.
    </p>
    <p>Therefore, to avoid confusion, when writing or speaking about “child labour”,
       it is best to clarify exactly what is meant. According to the ILO (International Labour Organization),
        child labour is work carried out by children under the age of 18 that in any way exploits them,
         causes them mental, physical or social harm, or places them in mortal danger. It is work that interferes
          or blocks their access to education and “deprives them of their childhood, their potential and their dignity”.</p>
          <h1> Bonded child labour in India</h1>
          <p>Bonded child labour is a system of forced, or partly forced, labour under which the child, or child's parent enter into an agreement, oral or written, with a creditor. The child performs work as in-kind repayment of credit. In the 2005 ILO report, debt-bondage in India emerged during the colonial period, as a means of obtaining reliable cheap labour, with loan and land-lease relationships implemented during that era of Indian history. These were regionally called Hali, or Halwaha, or Jeura systems; and was named by the colonial administration as the indentured labour system. These systems included bonded child labour. Over time, claims the ILO report, this traditional forms of long-duration relationships have declined.</p>
          <p>n 1977, India passed legislation that prohibits solicitation or use of bonded labour by anyone, of anyone including children. Evidence of continuing bonded child labour continue. A report by the Special Rapporteur to India's National Human Rights Commission, reported the discovery of 53 child labourers in 1996 in the state of Tamil Nadu during a surprise inspection. Each child or the parent had taken an advance of Rs. 1,00,000 to 2,50,000. The children were made to work for 12 to 14 hours a day and received only Rs. 2 to 3 per day as wages. According to an ILO report, the extent of bonded child labour is difficult to determine, but estimates from various social activist groups range up to 350,000 in 2001

          </p>
          <p>Despite its legislation, prosecutors in India rarely use the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act of 1976 to prosecute those responsible. According to one report,[49] the prosecutors have no direction from the central government that if a child is found to be underpaid, the case should be prosecuted not only under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 and the Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Act, 1986, the case should include charges under the Bonded Labour Act of India. The few enforcement actions have had some unintended effects. While there has been a decrease in children working in factories because of enforcement and community vigilance committees, the report claims poverty still compels children and poor families to work. The factory lends money to whoever needs it, puts a loom in the person's home, and then the family with children works out of their homes, bring finished product to pay interest and get some wages. The bonded child and family labour operations were moving out of small urban factories into rural homes.

          <h1>Diamond industry</h1>
          <p>In the year 1999, the International Labour Organization co-published a report with Universal Alliance of Diamond Workers, a trade union. The ILO report claimed that child labour is prevalent in the Indian diamond industry. International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) in a separate 1997 press release observed that child labour continued to flourish in India's diamond industry. Not everyone agreed with these claims. The South Gujarat Diamond Workers Association, another trade union, acknowledged child labour is present but it is not systematic, is less than 1% and against local industry norms. Local diamond industry businessmen too downplayed these charges

          </p>
          <p>The ILO paper claims that this is to avoid the complex labour laws of India. The export order is split, work is subcontracted through many middlemen, and most workers do not know the name of enterprise with the export order. In this environment, claims the ILO report, exact number of child labourers in India's diamond and gem industry is unknown; they estimate that child labourers in 1997 were between 10,000 and 20,000 out of 1.5 million total workers (about 1 in 100). The ILO report claims the causes for child labour include parents who send their children to work because they see education as expensive, education quality offering no real value, while artisan work in diamond and gem industry to be more remunerative as the child grows up</p>

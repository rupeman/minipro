     <h1> Child Labour </h1>
     <br><br>
     <p>Child labor is an illegal employment of children in any work that deprives them of their childhood, interferes with their ability to attend regular school, and is mentally, physically, socially, or morally dangerous and harmful. Legislation across the world prohibits child labor, but exceptions exist for work by child artists, family duties, and supervised training. In developing countries, where poverty and poor schooling opportunities persist, child labor remains prevalent. The vast majority of child labor occurs in rural settings and the informal urban economy. Globally, the incidence of child labor decreased from 25% to 10% between 1960 and 2003, according to the World Bank. However, the total number of child laborers remains high, with an estimated 168 million children aged 5–17 worldwide involved in child labor in 2013 1.</p>

<br>
     <h1>Pandemic Impact on Child Labor in India</h1>
     <p> Child labor is illegal in India for anyone under 14, except in special circumstances such as working for a family business. However, the coronavirus pandemic exacerbated this issue, leading to a sharp increase in the number of children being exploited as cheap laborers 2.</p>
     <br><h1>Rescue Operation in Madhya Pradesh</h1>
     <p>A total of 58 child laborers, including 39 boys and 19 girls, were rescued from a distillery in the Raisen district of Madhya Pradesh. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) spearheaded this operation in collaboration with the Association of Voluntary Action, also known as Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA) 3.
        Child labor remains a critical concern, compromising children’s education, restricting their rights, and perpetuating cycles of poverty. Efforts to combat child labor are essential for a better future.</p>

<br><br><br>
        <p>Government Initiatives and Policies: The Indian government has been actively working on strengthening its policies regarding child labor. The Ministry of Labour and Employment, along with other government bodies, has been implementing various measures to combat child labor, including stricter enforcement of existing laws and the introduction of new regulations aimed at eliminating child labor, especially in hazardous sectors.</p>
<p>Legislative Updates: There have been updates to India’s child labor laws, such as amendments to the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act. These updates focus on increasing penalties for violations, improving the monitoring mechanisms, and expanding the scope to cover more industries and types of work.

</p>
<p>
    Enforcement and Challenges: Despite legislative measures, enforcement remains a significant challenge. There are often reports of child labor continuing in informal sectors and in regions where regulatory oversight is weak. Efforts to improve enforcement are ongoing, but systemic issues and corruption sometimes hinder progress.
</p>
<br><br>
<p>Impact of Economic Factors: Economic challenges, including those exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, have led to an increase in child labor in certain areas. Families facing severe economic hardship may resort to sending their children to work, which impacts the effectiveness of anti-child labor initiatives.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    NGO and Civil Society Efforts: Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and civil society groups in India are actively working to combat child labor. They conduct awareness campaigns, support rehabilitation and education programs for children withdrawn from labor, and advocate for stronger enforcement of child protection laws.

    Case Studies and Reports: News often covers specific cases and reports from different states in India, highlighting the conditions under which children are working and the success stories of those who have been rescued and rehabilitated. These reports help shed light on the scale of the problem and the effectiveness of intervention efforts.
</p><br>
<p>
    International Attention: India’s efforts to combat child labor are also monitored by international organizations. Reports from bodies like UNICEF and the International Labour Organization often provide a global perspective on India's progress and challenges in addressing child labor.

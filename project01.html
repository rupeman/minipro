        <p class="summary">"Children in Chains" is a moving and eye-opening look at child labour, revealing the brutal realities that millions of children experience throughout the world.<br> Child labour is the practice of employing children in jobs that rob them of their childhood, interfere with their ability to attend normal school, and are psychologically, physically, socially, or morally detrimental. The practice has changed drastically throughout the years, with substantial legislative advances aimed at protecting infants.

        <h3 id="headdef">What is a Child labour?</h3>
        <p>Child labour refers to work that children are too young to perform or that –
          by its nature or circumstances – can be hazardous. Unlike activities that help children develop
          (such as contributing to light housework or taking on a job during school holidays), 
          child labour causes harm to a child’s health, safety or moral development.
          
          In its most insidious forms, child labour can amount to slavery or practices similar to slavery, 
          including the sale and trafficking of children. In some places, children may be forcibly recruited
          into armed conflict, used in the production and trafficking of drugs, or offered into prostitution.

        <h3>How common is child labour?</h3>
        <p>
          Child labour remains a persistent problem in the world today. 
          The latest global estimates indicate that some 160 million children were engaged
          in child labour at the beginning of 2020 – accounting for nearly 1 in 10 children globally.
          
          Child labour is most prevalent in low-income countries, yet more than half of all child labour 
          occurs in middle-income countries.

        <h3>What are the greatest risks associated with child labour?</h3>
        <p>No matter where or how it occurs, child labour restricts children from their most fundamental rights. 
          Many children driven into labour are cut off from schooling and health care – often at the time they need it most.
          In mining, they may be forced to work in deep underground shafts, to haul heavy loads of rock and to use toxic 
          chemicals to separate minerals or precious metals from ore.
          
          On the streets, traffic and exhaust fumes threaten children’s health and safety – as does, in extreme cases,
          the risk of being drawn into illicit activities.
          These are just a few of the dangers children driven into work may face. 
          What’s more, the isolated nature of some forms of child labour puts them at significant risk of abuse and trafficking.</p>
